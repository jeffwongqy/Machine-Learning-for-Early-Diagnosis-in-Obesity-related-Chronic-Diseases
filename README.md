# Machine-Learning-for-Early-Diagnosis-in-Obesity-related-Chronic-Diseases

Completed as part of the Capstone Project for Specialist Diploma in Applied Artificial Intelligence

Obesity is a significant global health issue, closely linked to chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancer. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in mitigating the adverse health impacts and economic burdens associated with these conditions. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for the early diagnosis of obesity-related chronic diseases.
